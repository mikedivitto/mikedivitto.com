I'm currently a Procurement Analyst for Columbia University in the City of New York in the Facilities & Operations department. I formerly worked as a Strategic Sourcing Analyst for Canon Business Process Services, also based out of New York City. I have past experience with leadership and technology through running clubs & organizations on campus at SUNY New Paltz, as well as graduating with a Computer Science Bachelor's and working as a Tech Support Student during my time at school.
